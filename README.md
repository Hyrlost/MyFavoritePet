# My Favorite Pet Mod

Hi! I'm Hyrlost. I just want to let you know what the mod is. It is a mod where we add new abilities to our pets! Like throw a ball and our dear pet will follow it and give it back to us! Also, if we feed our pet with their favorite food, they will give us some bonuses!

In this mod I worked with new goals to the wolf entity specially and new status effects to improve our abilities with our pet. Have fun! :D

Here you can find a gif where you can see the mod working:

Also, if you have any feedback or improvement I can do, please let me know, I will appreciate so much this action <3
